# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

Something I noticed about python is that it's somewhat similar to JavaScript. It does look a bit hard. 

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Some similarities were the way you have to use "print" to let the program run. There were so many specific things that were similar to JavaScript. A difference is how Python has more charaters/variables to program than JavaScript. 

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
Some things I learned through this assignment was how this programming language is structured.
